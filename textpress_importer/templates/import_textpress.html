    This importer can be used to import an exported textpress
    <b><tt>&lt;blog_name&gt;_export.tpxa</tt></b>
    file generated with the
    <b><tt><a href="{{ script_link }}"
      >textpress_exporter.py</a></tt></b> script.<br/>
    It won't handle attachments, so if your Textpress posts have images or files,
    you'll have to take care of them yourself and by hand, this is, you will
    probably have to edit the posts once imported and change the <tt>href</tt>
    locations to the new URL.
  {% endtrans %}</p>
  <p>{% trans %}It's also very hard to export from Textpress since no version was
    actually released. All versions are development versions at different stages.<br>
    The export script tries to abstract from that, however if you find troubles
    using the export script <a href="{{ bugs_link}}">file a ticket</a> and I'll
    try to address the problem.{% endtrans %}</p>
